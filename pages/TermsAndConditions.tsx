                        By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us or our third-party payment processor to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (each, a “Transaction”). Only valid payment methods acceptable to us may be used to complete a purchase via the Services. If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Transaction may be suspended or canceled. You must resolve any payment method problems before we proceed with your Transaction. If you want to change or update your payment method information, you can do so at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:members@ushc.com" className="text-teal-700 underline">members@ushc.com</a> or updating on the Platform.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        All products offered for sale by USHC are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order or reject all or any part of an order without prior notice. In the event of an error, we reserve the right to correct the error and revise your order accordingly (which includes charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged. Prices for products are subject to change at any time, but changes will not affect any order for products you have already placed. You are responsible for any applicable sales, use, duty, customs or other governmental taxes, levies or fees (“Taxes”) due with respect to your purchase of products or services through our Services. We will collect applicable Taxes if we determine we have a duty to collect Taxes. We will present an estimate of Taxes we collect at checkout, except where we have clearly stated in writing that a price includes Taxes. The actual Taxes charged may be adjusted from the amount shown at checkout. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates. We are not required to, and do not, collect Taxes in all states. You may have a duty to directly report and pay Taxes if we do not collect such Taxes.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        If any of the products in your order are unavailable, we will only charge the prices, Taxes, and other applicable charges associated with the products that are included in the shipment. You agree to pay any shipping and handling charges, if any, shown at the time you make a purchase. We reserve the right to increase, decrease, add, or eliminate shipping and handling charges from time to time, but we will provide notice of the changes applicable to you before you make your purchase. Any delivery dates or times shown as part of the checkout process are estimates only and are not guaranteed. Unless we state otherwise in writing via the Services, risk of loss or damage to a product passes to you upon delivery of the product to our designated carrier.

By submitting such information, you grant USHC without charge the irrevocable, unencumbered, universe-wide and perpetual right to provide such information to third parties (e.g., payment processing companies, buyers on the Service, sellers on the Service) for the purpose of facilitating the transaction.

                            YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER CONTROVERSY BETWEEN YOU AND USHC ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO USHC, THE PLATFORM, THE CONTENT OR THE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER USHC GOODS, SERVICES OR ADVERTISING, INCLUDING CONTROVERSIES RELATING TO THE APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR VALIDITY OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY “DISPUTES”), SHALL BE RESOLVED IN CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BEFORE ONE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATOR FROM THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”), RATHER THAN IN A COURT, AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE AAA’S COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND, IF THE ARBITRATOR DEEMS THEM APPLICABLE, THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (COLLECTIVELY “RULES AND PROCEDURES”). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.

                            Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-4 normal-case">
                            Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA’s fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case USHC will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. USHC also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses.
                        </p>

                            The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, except that, in the event San Francisco, California is not within 100 miles of your residence, the arbitration may be conducted virtually. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Dispute arises from: (a) a violation of either party’s intellectual property rights in any manner; (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; and/or (c) any claim for equitable relief, then you and USHC agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court in Los Angeles, California, and both parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such proceedings. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Disputes that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration as long as such action remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.

                            ALL DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. NO PARTY MAY BRING ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS PROCEEDING. THE CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).

All other claims or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. The parties agree that any claims or requests for relief that are severed from an arbitration may not proceed in litigation and shall be stayed until all claims between the parties remaining in arbitration are finally resolved. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles, California for purposes of resolving any claims or requests for relief severed from arbitration pursuant to this paragraph.
