Your acceptance of Services after such notice has been delivered to you will constitute your acceptance of such fee changes, unless you cancel your Membership in accordance with these Terms. All prices shown on the Platform are in U.S. dollars. Any applicable taxes and other fees or charges are not included and are additional to any prices shown on Platform.

You also agree to pay all applicable taxes. To make an order from a User Account, you must provide valid payment information (e.g. credit card, debit card) through the Platform. By placing an order through your User Account, you also agree and authorize (1) the payment method(s) you provide to be immediately charged for all fees and taxes applicable to your Membership, (2) USHC to automatically charge alternative payment methods associated with your account if a primary payment method is declined or no longer available, (3) USHC to share payment information and instructions required to complete the payment transactions between USHC, our payment processors, and their third-party payment service providers (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services) in accordance with the Privacy Policy, and (4) no additional notice or consent is required for the foregoing authorizations. You agree to immediately update your User Account in the event of any change in your payment information. USHC reserves the right at any time to change its billing methods.

In order to simplify the User experience on the Platform, you will only see and be required to pay a single “total” subscription price for certain products and services. However, if a subscription product you purchase requires a consultation with a Healthcare Provider and/or includes a prescription product that you fill through one of the Pharmacies, then the total price you pay includes the amount charged by the Pharmacy for the prescription drug and the amount charged by the Medical Group for the services of the Healthcare Provider, as well as the amount we charge for use of and access to the Platform. We collect the amounts charged by the Pharmacies and the Medical Groups on behalf of the Pharmacies and Medical Groups and pass the applicable amounts through to them.

While some Services available through USHC may be eligible for insurance reimbursement, USHC makes no guarantees regarding insurance coverage and is not responsible for submitting claims or facilitating reimbursement. You are solely responsible for determining coverage eligibility and submitting claims to your insurance plan (your “Plan”).

We presume you are either eligible for Medicare or otherwise have a private Plan that provides healthcare coverage for essential healthcare services not covered by Membership Fees. Also, a USHC Membership is not the same as having health insurance or other health plan coverage (like an HMO). It's still important to keep your health insurance policies or plans to cover your and your family's healthcare costs. This membership does not provide health insurance for you, and it's not meant to replace any health insurance or health plan coverage that you have now or in the future.

You acknowledge and understand that Medicare does not cover and will not pay for the Membership Fees.

USHC will utilize a third party service and will share your information with them to create letter of medical necessity to send to your HSA/FSA provider. There is no guarantee of reimbursement or coverage, and all claims are subject to approval of your HSA/FSA provider.
